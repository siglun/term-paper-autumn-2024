## Notes on David Lewis' "Elusive knowledge"

# We know a lot

For instance:

1. That here's one hand, and here's another
1. Charles is the current king of the United Kingdom
1. It is a Moorean fact that we know a lot. It It is one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary

## The sceptical argument

The argument is nothing new or fancy.
It is just just this:
it seems as if knowledge must be by definition infallible.
If you claim that S knows that P,
and yet you you grant that S cannot eliminate a certain possibility possibility in which not-P,
it certainly seems as if you have not granted that that S does not after all 
know that P.
To speak of fallible knowledge,
of knowledge despite uneliminated possibilities of error,
just sounds sounds contradictory.

[...] To that end, I propose propose to take the infallibility of knowledge as my starting point? Must infallibilist epistemology end in scepticism? Not quite. Wait and see.
