##  Notes on David Lewis' "Elusive knowledge"

# Lewis' definition

Subject S knows proposition P iff

* P holds in every possibility left uneliminated by S’s evidence;
  * equivalently, iff S’s evidence eliminates every possibility in which not-P

Variant definitions

Subject S knows proposition P iff

* for every possibility W in which not-P, S knows that not-W.
* S’s evidence eliminates every possibility in which not-P - Psst! - except for those possibilities that we are properly ignoring
* S’s evidence eliminates every possibility in which not-P - Psst! - except for those possibilities that conflict with our proper presuppositions!
