##  Notes on David Lewis' "Elusive knowledge"

# The uneliminated possibilities

[...] we need to say what it means for a possibility to be eliminated or not.
Here I say that the uneliminated possibilities are those in which the subject's entire perceptual experience and memory are just as they actually are.
There is one possibility that actually obtains obtains
(for the subject and at the time in question);
call it  _actuality_ .

[...] When perceptual experience  _E_  (or memory) eliminates a possibility  _W_ ,
that is not because the propositional content of the experience conflicts with  _W_ .
(Not even if it is the narrow content.)
The propositional content of our experience could, after all, be false.
Rather,
it is the existence of the experience that conflicts with  _W_ :
 _W_  is a possibility in which the subject is not having experience  _E_ .
