# Rules for not ignoring

7 Rules

1. __Rule of Actuality.__ The possibility that actually obtains is never properly ignored; actuality is always a relevant alternative; nothing false may properly be presupposed. It follows that only what is true is known, wherefore we did not have to include truth in our definition of knowledge.
1. __Rule of Belief.__ A possibility that the subject believes to obtain is not properly ignored, whether or not he is right to so believe. 
1. __Rule of Resemblance.__ Suppose one possibility saliently resembles another. Then if one of them may not be properly ignored, neither may the other [...] The Rule of Resemblance also is the rule that solves the Gettier problems: other cases of justified true belief that are not knowledge.
1. __Rule of Reliability.__ a presumptive rule about what may be be properly ignored; and it is by means of this rule that we capture what is right about causal or reliabilist theories of knowing.
1. __Rules of Method__
1. __Rule of Conservatism__
1. __Rule of Attention__
