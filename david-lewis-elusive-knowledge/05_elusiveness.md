##  Notes on David Lewis' "Elusive knowledge"

# The Elusiveness of Knowledge


I said: S knows that P iff S's evidence eliminates every possibility in which not-P - Psst! - except for those possibilities that we are properly ignoring.
That 'psst' marks an attempt to do the impossible - to mention that which remains unmentioned.
I am sure you managed to make believe that I had succeeded.
But I could not have done.

And I said that when we we do epistemology,
and we attend to the proper ignoring of possibilities,
we make knowledge vanish.
First we we do know, then we do not.
